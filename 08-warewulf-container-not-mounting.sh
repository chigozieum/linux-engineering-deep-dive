Ticket #2: Warewulf Container Not Mounting, crafted with the same structure and 1000+ words to guide beginners and home labbers clearly and practically.

üö® Ticket #2 ‚Äì Warewulf Container Not Mounting on Boot
Issue: Node boots via PXE, but fails with messages like:

"Cannot mount /dev/root" or
"Failed to mount root filesystem" or
"overlay not found"

üß† Summary
You‚Äôve PXE-booted your node successfully, DHCP and TFTP are working, and the kernel loads. But once it reaches the point where it should hand over control to the root file system (inside the Warewulf container), the process fails.

The node either:

Reboots into the bootloader loop

Hangs with kernel panic

Prints messages like mount: cannot mount /dev/root: No such file or directory

This is a classic Warewulf v4 container issue. The node was correctly served a kernel/initramfs but didn‚Äôt receive or mount its assigned container. This guide walks you through why it happens, how to diagnose it, and how to fix it from a home lab perspective.

üß≠ Background: What is a Container in Warewulf?
In Warewulf v4:

A ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù is not Docker or Podman, but a chroot-style compressed OS root file system.

These containers are assigned to each node and served over HTTP from the Warewulf controller.

At boot time, the kernel/initramfs mounts this container as /.

If the container is missing, corrupt, or not built, your node is booting into nothingness.

üß∞ Lab Setup Assumptions
Component	Value
PXE Server IP	192.168.200.25
Node Hostname	rocky02
Node IP Address	192.168.200.52
Assigned Container	rockylinux-9-lab

Let‚Äôs fix this problem, end to end.

üîç Step 1: Confirm Node is Assigned a Container
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node list rocky02 -o yaml
Expected output:

yaml
Copy
Edit
NodeName: rocky02
ContainerName: rockylinux-9-lab
RuntimeOverlay: generic
SystemOverlay: default
If ContainerName is missing or blank, assign one:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node set rocky02 --container rockylinux-9-lab
Then regenerate overlays:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl overlay build
üõë Step 2: Watch for Boot-Time Errors on Node
Boot the node and check:

PXE boot is successful

Kernel + initramfs load

Errors like:

txt
Copy
Edit
/init: line 401: can't open /etc/warewulf/container.img: No such file
mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on /root failed
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
This means the node never received or mounted its container.

üìÅ Step 3: Check if Container Exists on Controller
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl container list
If your assigned container isn‚Äôt in the list:

txt
Copy
Edit
CONTAINER NAME          FROZEN
---------------------------------
<none>
It means it wasn‚Äôt imported or got deleted.

Rebuild it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl container import docker://rockylinux:9 rockylinux-9-lab
Check again:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl container list
You should now see:

txt
Copy
Edit
CONTAINER NAME          FROZEN
rockylinux-9-lab        true
‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Rebuild the Container (In Case It‚Äôs Broken)
Even if the container shows up, it may be missing layers or metadata.

Rebuild it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl container build rockylinux-9-lab
This compresses the rootfs, mounts it into /var/lib/warewulf/containers/<name>, and prepares it to be served.

üåê Step 5: Verify HTTP Serving Is Working
Warewulf serves containers via its own internal HTTP server (:9873).

Check:

bash
Copy
Edit
ss -tuln | grep 9873
You should see:

txt
Copy
Edit
LISTEN 0 4096 :::9873 :::*
Manually test from a node or another machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://192.168.200.25:9873/container/rockylinux-9-lab.img
If this fails with 404, then your container wasn‚Äôt built properly or the node profile is misconfigured.

üîç Step 6: Check Overlay Mounts and Node Profile
List overlays:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl overlay list
Ensure both generic and default overlays are available.

Check node again:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node list rocky02 -o yaml
If RuntimeOverlay or SystemOverlay are missing, fix it:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node set rocky02 --runtime-overlay generic --system-overlay default
wwctl overlay build
üß™ Step 7: Reboot and Observe Logs
Reboot the node and simultaneously tail the server log:

bash
Copy
Edit
journalctl -fu wwd
Also check overlay logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
tail -n 100 /var/log/messages
Success looks like:

txt
Copy
Edit
[+] Sending container rockylinux-9-lab.img to 192.168.200.52
Failure looks like:

txt
Copy
Edit
[-] Container image not found
üõ°Ô∏è Optional: Reassign + Rebuild from Scratch
If unsure, reassign the node completely:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node delete rocky02
wwctl node add rocky02 \
  --ipaddr=192.168.200.52 \
  --netdev=eth0 \
  --hwaddr=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:02 \
  --container=rockylinux-9-lab \
  --profile=default
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl overlay build
wwctl bootstrap build
Reboot your node again.

üßº Bonus: Clean Up Old Broken Containers
List container directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -lh /var/lib/warewulf/containers/
Delete old or broken ones:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf /var/lib/warewulf/containers/rockylinux-9-old*
üìà Observability Tip
Add this container-mount point to Prometheus:

Enable logging of overlay/container failures

Use Prometheus Node Exporter‚Äôs mountpoint and filesystem metrics

Create Grafana alerts if / is not mounted from the expected image

‚úÖ Final Confirmation
After a successful fix:

The node boots fully to the login prompt

df -h shows root mounted from squashfs or overlayfs

/etc/warewulf/ exists inside the node

You can SSH into the node or run container jobs

üß† Root Cause Summary
This issue is usually caused by one of:

Problem	Fix
Container never imported	wwctl container import
Container deleted	Re-import and build
Container not assigned to node	wwctl node set
Container corrupted	wwctl container build
Node booted before container was ready	Reboot after full rebuild
