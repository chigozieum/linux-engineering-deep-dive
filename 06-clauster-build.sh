🧰 The Home Labber’s Journey: Building Clusters from Scratch
As a home labber, you're not just tinkering—you’re simulating the infrastructure of tomorrow. The moment you start thinking about clusters, PXE boot, containerized nodes, and automated overlays, you’ve crossed into the realm of real-world infrastructure engineering.

This documentation walks you through the experience of becoming a powerful home labber, capable of building and managing your own Linux-based compute cluster.

💡 Why Build a Cluster?
Before we dive into configs and cables, let’s ask a simple question: Why bother building a cluster in your home lab?

✅ You want to simulate real-world data center tasks.

✅ You’re practicing for DevOps, HPC, or cybersecurity roles.

✅ You want to test PXE booting, DHCP, TFTP, and provisioning automation.

✅ You believe learning hands-on beats certifications alone.

If any of that resonates, you're ready to start.

🧱 The Lego Mindset: Repeatable, Modular Builds
Like stacking LEGO blocks, each part of your lab should be repeatable and modular. A true cluster builder doesn’t reinstall from scratch every time. Instead, they use tools like:

Warewulf – to manage node provisioning via containers and overlays

DHCP – to assign boot-time IPs and files

TFTP – to serve PXE boot files

iPXE – to chainload bootloaders and OS images

🔌 Essential Hardware Setup
Your hardware doesn’t have to be expensive:

Component	Example
PXE Master Node	Any Linux-capable machine
Cluster Nodes	Old desktops, laptops, or VMs
Network	A simple unmanaged switch
Storage	USB/NAS/NFS for image sharing

Minimum: One controller + one bootable node + Ethernet = full lab.

⚙️ Step-by-Step Cluster Bootstrapping
1. Install Your PXE Master Node
Use Rocky Linux 9 or another stable OS as your PXE Master.

Install basic tools:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dnf install -y dhcp-server tftp-server xinetd ipxe-bootimgs
Install Warewulf:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -s https://warewulf.org/install.sh | sudo bash
2. Set Up DHCP for PXE Boot
Edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf:

conf
Copy
Edit
subnet 192.168.200.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.200.50 192.168.200.99;
  option routers 192.168.200.1;
  next-server 192.168.200.25;
  filename "undionly.kpxe";
}
Restart DHCP:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart dhcpd
3. Enable TFTP and PXE Boot Files
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo cp /usr/share/ipxe/undionly.kpxe /var/lib/tftpboot/
sudo systemctl enable --now tftp
Test from another node:

bash
Copy
Edit
tftp 192.168.200.25
tftp> get undionly.kpxe
4. Import Your OS Container
Download a base OS (e.g., Rocky Linux):

bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl container import docker://rockylinux:9 rockylinux-9-lab
5. Create Your First Node
bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl node add rocky01 \
  --ipaddr=192.168.200.51 \
  --netdev=eth0 \
  --hwaddr=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:01 \
  --container=rockylinux-9-lab \
  --profile=default
6. Build Overlays and Boot Images
bash
Copy
Edit
wwctl overlay build
wwctl bootstrap build
Now boot the node from PXE. Watch the magic happen.

🧠 What You Learn Doing This
When you bootstrap your own cluster, you don’t just learn commands—you gain real operational experience:

Task	Skill Learned
DHCP/TFTP	Core Linux networking
Warewulf	Cluster automation
Container OS	Immutable infrastructure
Overlay Mgmt	System reproducibility
Log Analysis	Real-world troubleshooting

🛠️ Real-World Scenarios You Can Simulate
CI/CD Node Deployment: Provision test runners for GitHub Actions clones.

Cyber Lab Sim: Create attack/defend Linux labs with reproducible environments.

AI Training Cluster: Feed small datasets into distributed ML jobs.

SysAdmin Practice: Reinstall, reset, and reconfigure hundreds of times.

Edge Node Deployment: Treat home devices as nodes—secure, bootable, resettable.

🚨 Gotchas to Expect
Being a home labber comes with pain points. Expect and embrace:

DHCP misfires: Use tcpdump to see what's happening

PXE errors: “No boot file received” often means filename is wrong

MAC mismatch: The MAC in DHCP must match the node in Warewulf

Overlay not found: Did you overlay build?

Keep logs open:

bash
Copy
Edit
journalctl -u dhcpd -f
journalctl -u tftp -f
📁 Organize Your Lab Like a Pro
Start documenting every success and failure. Create a directory like this:

perl
Copy
Edit
my-cluster-lab/
├── README.md
├── configs/
│   ├── dhcpd.conf
│   ├── warewulf.conf
├── overlays/
│   └── ssh.keys
├── nodes/
│   └── rocky01.yaml
├── scripts/
│   ├── rebuild_node.sh
│   └── test_dhcp.sh
Then push it to GitHub or store it in your GitLab CI setup.

🧱 Final Word: You’re Not a Hobbyist Anymore
When you build and automate Linux clusters in your home lab, you are:

A systems engineer in training

An infrastructure architect under the radar

A DevOps or SRE simulating real pipelines

A cybersecurity engineer preparing real node deployments

Don’t underestimate what you're doing.

You're not just "playing"—you’re learning what powers national labs, top cloud providers, and bleeding-edge research facilities.

🧩 Bonus: What to Learn Next?
Once your first cluster boots:

Install Prometheus + Grafana on the PXE server for monitoring.

Secure the setup using Firewalld and Fail2Ban.

Deploy an internal DNS using dnsmasq.

Expand into Kubernetes by converting your Warewulf nodes into K8s workers.

Simulate attacks using Red Team labs on provisioned nodes.
